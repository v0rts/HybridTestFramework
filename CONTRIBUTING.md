# Contributing to HybridTestFramework

This framework welcomes contributions from everyone. There are a
number of ways you can help:

## Bug Reports

When opening new issues or commenting on existing issues please make
sure discussions are related to concrete technical issues.

It's imperative that issue reports outline the steps to reproduce
the defect. If the issue can't be reproduced it will be closed.
Please provide and describe what results you are seeing and what results you expect.

## Feature Requests

If you find that some functions are missing, feel free to open an issue
with details describing what feature(s) you'd like added or changed.

If you'd like a hand at trying to implement the feature yourself, please feel free to create a pull request.

## Code Optimization

You are always welcome to improve the code optimizations wherever required.
